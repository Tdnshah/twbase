**:warning: WARNING: TWBase is under development and not yet ready for production üêû**

## Recommended Modules

As TWBase Theme use [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) I recommends you to install [TWBase Theme Utilities](https://github.com/drupix/twbase_utils) modules with this theme. It load the `styles.css` provided by **TWBase Theme** and add the `prose` (`tw-prose`) extra class to the editor `body` to reflects the frontend while editing node in admin section. Otherwise the content in your editor may look slightly poor and naked... üôÄ. The module also provide an admin interface to control the frontpage showcase content and last but not least: it allows you to define showcase and related options per content type ü•≥.

## Demo

You can view a very [basic demo](https://twbase-theme.drupal-solutions.ch/) with the [TWBase Theme Utilities](https://github.com/drupix/twbase_utils) modules installed.

## Development dependencies

* [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) ^2.2.17
  * All is said!
* [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
  * Transforming styles with JS plugins
* [postcss-cli](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli)
  * CLI for postcss
* [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
  * PostCSS plugin to inline @import rules content
* [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
  * Parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to rules by Can I Use
* [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) / [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/chokidar-cli)
  * Minimal and efficient cross-platform file watching library
* [cssnano](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano)
  * A modular minifier, built on top of the PostCSS ecosystem.

To install all dependencies run **`npm install`** from theme root directory.

## CSS compilation

### Development compilation

The Just-In-Time mode (**`jit`** ) is activated in `tailwind.config.js` which allows to compile css on the fly... bzzzzz...

To **watch** changes while *"playing"* with `css` and html `class`, run  **`npm run watch`** from theme root directory.

### Building for production

When building for production, you should always use Tailwind‚Äôs purge option to tree-shake unused styles and optimize your final build size.

**üìå As I'm a little üêí still learning the intricacies of Tailwind, this part needs refinement.**

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: {
    // mode: "all",
    // enabled: true,
    preserveHtmlElements: false,
    options: {
      keyframes: true,
    },
    content: [
      './**/*.twig',
      '../../../{modules,themes}/custom/**/*.twig'
    ],
  },
  ...
}
```

By default, for development purpose the outputed css file is not minified. To minify it, uncomment `cssnano` in the plugins section of `postcss.config.js` :

```javascript
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    'postcss-import': {},
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
    //Uncomment this to minify the outputed css file
//     cssnano: {
//       preset: "default",
//     },
  }
}
```

When you're happy with all this, **build** the final css file by running the command **`npm run build`** from theme root directory.
